			<p class="my-4 font-bold">iOGaming wasn't just a virtual space; it was a vibrant community that flourished for nearly a decade. At its zenith, we boasted a diverse membership of over 3,000 individuals from around the globe. Many of us forged enduring friendships, some found love and tied the knot, while a few even immortalized their commitment with an iO logo tattoo, a testament to the depth of our bond.</p>
	
			<p class="my-4 font-bold">Leading iOGaming was one of the most enriching experiences of my life. Witnessing the support and camaraderie that extended beyond the virtual confines of 2Fort was immensely rewarding. I firmly believe there will never be another gaming community quite like the one we built together.</p>
	
			<p class="my-4 font-bold">I am eternally grateful for each and every one of you who made this community so special. While this may seem like a farewell, it's not a goodbye. Perhaps one day we'll reignite iOGaming for the next generation. As the saying goes, "It Ain't Over 'til It's Over."</p>
